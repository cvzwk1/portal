The Big Crunch is a theoretical event in which the universe continues to expand but ultimately contracts and collapses upon itself. This would happen after the universe has expanded for an infinite amount of time. The Big Crunch is a consequence of the Big Bang, which started 13.8 billion years ago and continues to this day. The Big Crunch theory proposes that all the energy in the universe will become evenly distributed over time, preventing any further movement of objects (galaxies, stars, planets, etc.). This is referred to as the "heat death of the universe" [Source 0](https://icjs.us/theoretical-astrophysics-research-on-how-the-big-crunch-builds-to-the-big-bounce-theory/), [Source 3](https://science.howstuffworks.com/dictionary/astronomy-terms/big-crunch.htm).

In terms of spatial coordinates, the Big Crunch would occur at the center of the observable universe. This is because all matter and energy in the universe is currently moving towards this point due to the expansion of the universe. Once the universe reaches its maximum size, it will start contracting again, eventually leading to a Big Crunch [Source 0](https://icjs.us/theoretical-astrophysics-research-on-how-the-big-crunch-builds-to-the-big-bounce-theory/).

The Doppler effect, on the other hand, is a physical phenomenon that explains why the pitch of a sound changes as the source of the sound moves towards or away from an observer. In astronomy, the Doppler effect is used to measure the speed of a moving object and the frequency of its emitted waves, such as light waves.

In the context of the universe, the Doppler effect is used to study the motion of galaxies. When a galaxy moves away from us, the light it emits gets shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, a phenomenon known as redshift. Conversely, when a galaxy moves towards us, the light it emits gets shifted towards the blue end of the spectrum, a phenomenon known as blueshift. By studying these shifts, astronomers can determine the speed and direction of the galaxy's motion.

Current observations show that objects further from the earth appear redder (they are ‘red-shifted’) which indeed suggests they are moving away from our relative point of view, providing support for universal expansion [Source 0](https://icjs.us/theoretical-astrophysics-research-on-how-the-big-crunch-builds-to-the-big-bounce-theory/).
