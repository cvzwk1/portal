Cosmic rays are high-energy particles that originate from outer space and travel at nearly the speed of light. They consist mainly of protons, atomic nuclei, and high-energy atomic nuclei. These particles are produced during violent events in the universe, such as supernovae explosions and active galactic nuclei [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic-ray_observatory).

There are several cosmic-ray observatories worldwide that monitor and study cosmic rays. These observatories collect data on the direction, energy, and other properties of cosmic rays. Some of these observatories are located in remote areas to minimize interference from ground-based radio signals [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic-ray_observatory).

One such observatory is the Pierre Auger Observatory, which is located in Argentina. It's designed to detect high-energy cosmic rays, including ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), which have energies above 10^19 electron volts. The observatory uses a network of detectors spread across a wide area to capture cosmic rays and study their properties [Source 4](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/16/17690740/cosmic-rays-universe-theory-science).

Another observatory that has made significant contributions to the study of cosmic rays is the Tibet ASg Experiment, located in Tibet, China. This observatory has an altitude of 4300 meters above sea level, which provides a clear view of the cosmos and reduces the influence of the Earth's atmosphere on the measurements [Source 3](https://www.yachaytech.edu.ec/en/noticia/detecting-cosmic-rays-from-south-america/).

While these observatories can provide valuable data on cosmic rays, it's important to note that cosmic rays are not evenly distributed throughout the universe. Their intensity varies depending on the location and the direction of the cosmic rays. Therefore, the data collected by these observatories can provide insights into the processes that generate cosmic rays and the distribution of cosmic rays in the universe [Source 1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic-ray_observatory), [Source 3](https://www.yachaytech.edu.ec/en/noticia/detecting-cosmic-rays-from-south-america/), [Source 4](https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/2019/7/16/17690740/cosmic-rays-universe-theory-science).

Extracting data from cosmic rays involves using specialized instruments and techniques to detect and measure these high-energy particles. Here is a general process of how this can be done:

1. **Detection:** The first step in extracting data from cosmic rays is detection. Specialized detectors, such as Cherenkov counters, scintillators, and calorimeters, are used to detect cosmic rays. These detectors work by converting the high-energy cosmic rays into electromagnetic radiation, which can then be measured [Source 0](https://lpsc.in2p3.fr/crdb/).

2. **Measurement:** After detection, the next step is measurement. The detectors produce a signal that can be measured to determine the energy and direction of the cosmic ray. This involves analyzing the signal and applying mathematical models to extract the desired information [Source 0](https://lpsc.in2p3.fr/crdb/).

3. **Analysis:** Once the measurements are taken, they can be analyzed to gain insights into the properties of cosmic rays. This might involve comparing the measurements with theoretical predictions, identifying patterns in the data, or using machine learning algorithms to analyze the data [Source 0](https://lpsc.in2p3.fr/crdb/).

4. **Data Extraction:** Finally, the data can be extracted for further analysis or for sharing with the scientific community. This might involve exporting the data in a specific format, such as XML or ROOT, which can be easily imported into other software or databases [Source 2](https://tools.ssdc.asi.it/CosmicRays/).

It's important to note that this is a simplified explanation of the process. The actual process of extracting data from cosmic rays can be quite complex and requires a deep understanding of physics and engineering. Additionally, the specific equipment and techniques used can vary depending on the specific goals of the experiment and the properties of the cosmic rays being studied.

The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in Argentina, is one of the primary observatories that study cosmic rays. Recently, the observatory announced that it has solid evidence that the most energetic particles in nature come from sources outside the Milky Way [Source 4](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/high-energy-cosmic-rays-come-from-outside-our-galaxy/).

In a study analyzing 12 years' worth of data, the researchers found that particles in the upper range of energies were more likely to come from a region of the sky outside the Milky Way’s disk. This asymmetry is roughly consistent with the distribution of neighboring galaxies. While the study does not pinpoint individual sources of the cosmic rays, or explain how they reach their highest energies, the researchers hope that it is a first step towards understanding their origins [Source 4](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/high-energy-cosmic-rays-come-from-outside-our-galaxy/).

Another important aspect of the study is that it strongly disfavors the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way as a major source of the higher-energy particles. The most likely sources continue to be astrophysical phenomena that generate extremely intense magnetic fields, inside which charged particles can pinball around and gain energy. These include active galactic nuclei—supermassive black holes spewing jets of matter at near-light speed—and the stellar explosions called γ-ray bursts [Source 4](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/high-energy-cosmic-rays-come-from-outside-our-galaxy/).

In recent years, several significant gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have been observed. Here are two notable ones:

1. **GRB 221009A:** On October 9, 2022, a particularly bright gamma-ray burst named GRB 221009A, also known as the BOAT (the brightest of all time), was observed. This gamma-ray burst was so intense that it triggered detectors on numerous spacecraft and observatories around the globe. The burst was so bright that it effectively blinded most gamma-ray instruments in space, which means they could not directly record the real intensity of the emission. U.S. scientists were able to reconstruct this information from the Fermi data. They then compared the results with those from the Russian team working on Konus data and Chinese teams analyzing observations from the GECAM-C detector on their SATech-01 satellite and instruments on their Insight-HXMT observatory. Together, they proved the burst was 70 times brighter than any yet seen [Source 0](https://www.nasa.gov/universe/nasa-missions-study-what-may-be-a-1-in-10000-year-gamma-ray-burst/), [Source 1](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/recent-gamma-ray-burst-may-be-the-brightest-ever-seen/).

2. **GRB 230307A:** In March 2023, the second-brightest gamma-ray burst ever observed was observed. This gamma-ray burst, known as GRB 230307A, was caused by a neutron star merger. The explosion was observed using an array of ground and space-based telescopes, including NASA's James Webb Space Telescope, Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, and Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Researchers found the heavy chemical element tellurium, in the aftermath of the explosion. Other elements such as iodine and thorium, which are needed to sustain life on Earth, are also likely to be among the material ejected by the explosion, also known as a kilonova [Source 4](https://phys.org/news/2023-10-second-brightest-gamma-ray-elements-life.html).
