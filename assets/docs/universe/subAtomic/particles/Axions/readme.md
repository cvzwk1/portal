An axion is a hypothetical elementary particle that was first proposed by the Peccei–Quinn theory in 1977 to solve the strong CP problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). If axions exist and have low mass within a certain range, they are of interest as potential components of cold dark matter [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion).

Axions were initially postulated as a solution to a problem in the Standard Model of particle physics, specifically the part built on the theory of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), which governs the fundamental particles we call quarks and gluons. QCD is highly successful, but it predicts properties we've never seen in the neutron (which is made of quarks) [Source 1](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/enter-the-axion).

Axions may also be produced at particle colliders, particularly in electron-positron collisions and ultra-peripheral heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. These searches are sensitive for rather large axion masses between 100 MeV/c² and hundreds of GeV/c² [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion).

In supersymmetric theories, the axion has both a scalar and a fermionic superpartner. The fermionic superpartner of the axion is called the axino, and the scalar superpartner is called the saxion or dilaton. They are all bundled in a chiral superfield. The axino has been predicted to be the lightest supersymmetric particle in such a model. Due to this property, it is considered a candidate for dark matter [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axion).

The observational implications of axions are still not fully understood across different possible masses for the particle. Lighter axions could form a galaxy-halo–sized condensate, while heavier ones may form axsteroids in the early universe. However, we don't yet know what they do at later times, specifically, at the time in which we now live [Source 1](https://www.americanscientist.org/article/enter-the-axion).
