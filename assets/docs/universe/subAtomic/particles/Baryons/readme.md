# Baryons   

are a class of elementary particles that are composed of three quarks and are held together by the strong nuclear force. They are part of the larger group of hadrons, which also includes mesons. Baryons play a crucial role in the structure of matter and are important constituents of atomic nuclei. Here's an overview of baryons:

**Baryons**:

1. **Composition**: Baryons are made up of three quarks. Quarks are elementary particles that come in various "flavors" (up, down, charm, strange, top, and bottom). Protons and neutrons, which are the building blocks of atomic nuclei, are examples of baryons.

2. **Quark Combinations**: Baryons are formed by combining quarks of different flavors to satisfy the rules of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), the theory that describes the strong force.

3. **Baryon Number Conservation**: Baryons are subject to baryon number conservation. In particle interactions, the total baryon number before and after the interaction remains constant.

4. **Strong Nuclear Force**: Baryons are held together by the strong nuclear force, which is mediated by gluons (another type of elementary particle). The strong force is responsible for binding quarks within baryons despite their repulsive electromagnetic charges.

5. **Hadron Colliders**: Baryons are studied in particle colliders such as the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Collisions at high energies allow scientists to probe the internal structure of baryons and explore the behavior of the strong force.

6. **Baryon Resonances**: Baryon resonances are excited states of baryons that can decay into lower-energy states through particle interactions. These resonances provide insights into the detailed structure of baryons.

7. **Cosmic Significance**: Baryons play a crucial role in the formation of visible matter in the universe. They are the building blocks of atomic nuclei, which make up the matter in stars, planets, and galaxies.

8. **Quark Dynamics**: The study of baryons and their internal quark dynamics contributes to our understanding of QCD, which governs the behavior of the strong force and describes how quarks and gluons interact.

9. **Exotic Baryons**: While the majority of observed baryons consist of three quarks, there is ongoing research into the possibility of "exotic" baryons that could have more complex quark configurations.

Baryons are fundamental constituents of matter and play a critical role in the behavior of particles and the structure of the universe. Their study helps us unravel the mysteries of the strong nuclear force, the forces that govern the behavior of quarks, and the formation of atomic nuclei.

Baryogenesis is the process of creating an excess of baryons over anti-baryons in the early universe, starting from a Universe with equal numbers of both. The baryogenesis problem arises from the fact that the universe is composed almost entirely of ordinary matter, with virtually no antimatter. The Standard Model of particle physics does not predict why this imbalance exists. Theories such as the CP violation mechanism propose that this imbalance arises from the weak nuclear force, which is responsible for the transformation of matter into antimatter. However, this theory cannot fully account for the observed matter-antimatter asymmetry. A theory of baryogenesis requires three main ingredients: B violation, CP violation, and a departure from equilibrium, otherwise the baryon number will relax to zero. The conclusion is that baryogenesis must take place either from a mechanism occurring before the electroweak phase transition or during it. The most emblematic example in the first category is leptogenesis, where a lepton asymmetry is produced from the decay of heavy right-handed neutrinos. The second category, electroweak baryogenesis, involves electroweak-scale physics only and is therefore testable at the LHC. Electroweak baryogenesis requires a first-order electroweak phase transition to provide a large otherwise the baryon asymmetry is washed out. The axion, a hypothetical particle, has been proposed as a possible solution to this problem. The axion is a particle that would couple to the weak nuclear force, allowing it to mediate the transformation of matter into antimatter. However, the axion has not been observed, and it remains a theoretical possibility.

The relationship between baryogenesis and the Higgs boson is significant, particularly in the context of electroweak baryogenesis. Electroweak baryogenesis is a theoretical scenario that relies on physics testable at present high-energy collider facilities. It is particularly attractive because it is connected to the properties of the Higgs boson and the electroweak phase transition. The strength of the electroweak phase transition is linked to the properties of the Higgs boson, and the scenario of electroweak baryogenesis has crucial implications for Higgs physics. The Higgs boson, as a very special particle in the Standard Model, is believed to have played a role in contributing to the processes of baryogenesis. Therefore, the properties of the Higgs boson and its interactions are closely related to the mechanisms and conditions that led to the asymmetry between matter and antimatter in the early universe. This connection underscores the importance of studying the Higgs boson in the context of understanding the fundamental processes that shaped the universe's evolution, including the generation of the matter-antimatter asymmetry.

The Higgs boson, a key particle in the Standard Model of particle physics, plays a crucial role in the processes of baryogenesis and dark matter production. Baryogenesis is the process by which the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry was generated. The Higgs boson contributes to this process by providing a mechanism for including weakly interacting massive vector bosons in the Standard Model and for assigning masses to quarks and leptons [Source 1](https://cds.cern.ch/record/324446/files/9704347.pdf).

Electroweak baryogenesis is a theoretical scenario that relies on physics testable at present high-energy collider facilities. It is particularly attractive because it is related to the properties of the Higgs boson and the electroweak phase transition. The strength of the electroweak phase transition is connected to the properties of the Higgs boson. In this context, the Higgs boson is implicated in contributing to the processes of baryogenesis and dark matter production [Source 2](https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevD.86.013009).

In supersymmetric theories, the axion has both a scalar and a fermionic superpartner. The fermionic superpartner of the axion is called the axino, and the scalar superpartner is called the saxion or dilaton. They are all bundled in a chiral superfield. The axino has been predicted to be the lightest supersymmetric particle in such a model. Due to this property, it is considered a candidate for dark matter [Source 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4247394/).

The observational implications of axions are still not fully understood across different possible masses for the particle. Lighter axions could form a galaxy-haloâ€“sized condensate, while heavier ones may form axsteroids in the early universe. However, we don't yet know what they do at later times, specifically, at the time in which we now live [Source 4](https://arxiv.org/abs/hep-ph/0507259).
