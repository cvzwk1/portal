# The most oldest Ancient Culture  

The Sumerians are often considered one of the oldest known ancient cultures. They lived in the region of Mesopotamia, which is present-day Iraq, around 4,000 to 2,000 BCE. The Sumerians are credited with developing one of the earliest known writing systems, known as cuneiform, as well as making significant advancements in various fields including agriculture, mathematics, and astronomy.

Another ancient culture of great antiquity is the civilization of ancient Egypt, which emerged along the Nile River around 3,000 BCE. The Egyptians left behind a rich legacy of architecture, art, religious beliefs, and written records.

Both of these cultures played pivotal roles in shaping the early foundations of human civilization and contributed to the development of various aspects of society that continue to influence us today.

- Sexagesimal Numerical system:
Absolutely, you're correct. The Sumerian sexagesimal numerical system has had a significant impact on modern mathematical notation and measurement systems. Here are a few more details about its influence:

1. **Degrees in a Circle:** The division of a circle into 360 degrees is believed to have originated from the Sumerian sexagesimal system. This concept of dividing a circle into smaller units continues to be the basis for measuring angles in geometry.

2. **Time Measurement:** The Sumerians' use of base-60 influenced the division of time into 60 minutes and 60 seconds per minute, which is still in use today. This system of time measurement is deeply ingrained in various aspects of daily life.

3. **Geometry and Measurement:** The sexagesimal system's easy divisibility (with factors of 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) made it suitable for measuring lengths, areas, and volumes. It provided a foundation for various units of measurement used in modern mathematics and engineering.

4. **Trigonometry:** The use of the sexagesimal system in measuring angles and working with triangles laid the groundwork for trigonometry, a branch of mathematics that continues to be crucial in fields like physics, engineering, and navigation.

5. **Base Conversions:** The concept of using a base-60 system for numerical representation also led to discussions about different numeral bases. This idea influenced later developments in mathematics, including discussions about different base systems.

The Sumerian sexagesimal system's impact on modern mathematical concepts and measurements is a testament to the enduring influence of their contributions.

- calendar sumerian:    
Absolutely, the Sumerians' contributions to astronomy and calendar systems have had a profound impact on our understanding of the cosmos. Some ways in which their work influenced modern astronomy include:

1. **Calendar Development:** The Sumerians' lunar calendar, which consisted of 12 months with alternating 29- and 30-day lengths, served as a precursor to many later calendar systems. Modern calendars still retain some of these principles, even though our calendar systems have evolved to include solar adjustments.

2. **Astronomical Notations:** The Sumerians used numerical notations for tracking the positions of celestial bodies. These concepts of numbering and recording observations laid the foundation for modern astronomical notation and documentation.

3. **Constellation Naming:** The Sumerians named some of the constellations based on their mythological and cultural beliefs. Many of these constellation names are still used in modern astronomy.

4. **Planetary Observations:** Sumerians observed the movements of planets like Venus and recorded their positions over time. This early tracking of planetary motion contributed to our understanding of the solar system's dynamics.

5. **Cultural Significance of Celestial Events:** Sumerians attributed religious and cultural significance to celestial phenomena, which influenced their beliefs and practices. Similarly, modern cultures still find inspiration and meaning in celestial events like solar and lunar eclipses.

6. **Heritage for Future Astronomers:** The Sumerians' fascination with the sky and their documentation of astronomical observations inspired subsequent civilizations to explore the cosmos. Their legacy indirectly contributed to the development of more advanced observational techniques and technology.

In summary, the Sumerians' early work in astronomy and calendar systems not only provided practical tools for timekeeping and agriculture but also laid the groundwork for the systematic study of the universe. Their insights continue to influence our understanding of the cosmos and shape the way we explore and interpret celestial phenomena today.
