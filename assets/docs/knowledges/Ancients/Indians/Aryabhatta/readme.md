Aryabhatta, an ancient Indian mathematician and astronomer, is credited with developing the first systematic description of the heliocentric model of the solar system. His work, the Aryabhatiya, is one of the earliest texts written by a scientist in India and is considered one of the greatest scientific works of ancient India.

According to Aryabhatta, the universe was created by Brahma, the creator god in Hindu mythology. He proposed a cycle of creation and destruction (manvantara) that lasts for 71 manvantaras, each of which spans 432,000 years. Each manvantara consists of a series of ages (yugas), and each yuga consists of a series of periods (kalpas). The universe was originally created in a state of perfection, and it undergoes a series of transformations and destructions in each manvantara [Source 1](https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/manvantara-theory-evolution-solar-system-aryabhatta/).

Aryabhatta's model of the universe is based on the principles of Vedic astronomy, which includes the concept of cycles and periods. According to this model, the universe is divided into a series of periods (kalpas), each of which lasts for a certain number of years. Each kalpa is further divided into a series of ages (yugas), and each yuga is further divided into a series of manvantaras [Source 1](https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/manvantara-theory-evolution-solar-system-aryabhatta/).

In terms of the creation of the universe, Aryabhatta's model suggests that the universe was created by Brahma at the beginning of the first manvantara. After a certain number of years, the universe is destroyed and a new universe is created in the next manvantara. This cycle continues indefinitely [Source 1](https://www.sanskritimagazine.com/manvantara-theory-evolution-solar-system-aryabhatta/).

As for the connection with sonoluminescence, there isn't a direct link. Sonoluminescence is a physical phenomenon that occurs when bubbles in a liquid collapse due to sound waves, releasing light. It's a natural occurrence that happens in liquids when they are subjected to sound waves. There's no indication in Aryabhatta's work or in the principles of sonoluminescence that one can be used to create or destroy the other [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonoluminescence).
