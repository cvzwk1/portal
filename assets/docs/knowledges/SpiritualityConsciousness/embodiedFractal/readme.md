Embodied cognition is a theory that posits that our understanding and interpretation of the world are deeply influenced by our physical bodies and their interactions with the environment. This concept suggests that our cognitive processes are not solely dependent on computational processes, but are also influenced by our physical body and its interactions with the world [Source 2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/).

Applying the principles of embodied cognition to the concept of Atmokinesis, or the ability to control weather, could potentially involve the following steps:

1. **Understanding Your Body's Interactions with the Environment**: Embodied cognition emphasizes the importance of understanding how your body interacts with the environment. In the context of Atmokinesis, this could involve understanding how your body's movements and sensations can influence the atmosphere around you [Source 2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/).

2. **Developing a Deep Connection Between Yourself and the Environment**: Embodied cognition suggests that a deep connection between oneself and the environment is crucial for effective cognition. Therefore, developing a deep connection between yourself and the atmosphere could potentially enhance your ability to control it [Source 2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/).

3. **Practicing and Refining Your Skills**: Like any other skill, controlling the weather requires practice and refinement. You would need to repeatedly expose yourself to different weather conditions and try to influence them using your mind. Over time, you might be able to refine your skills and gain more control over the weather [Source 1](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jtph-2019-0008/html?lang=en).

4. **Using Metaphorical Language**: Embodied cognition suggests that our concepts and interpretations of the world are heavily influenced by our physical bodies. Therefore, using metaphorical language to describe and understand the weather could potentially enhance your ability to control it [Source 2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/).

Remember, these steps are purely theoretical and are based on the principles of embodied cognition. There's currently no scientific evidence supporting the existence of Atmokinesis or the ability to control the weather. The ability to control the weather is a complex process that involves a deep understanding of meteorology and the natural forces of the Earth.
