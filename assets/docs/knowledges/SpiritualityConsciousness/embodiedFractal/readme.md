Embodied cognition is a theory that posits that our understanding and interpretation of the world are deeply influenced by our physical bodies and their interactions with the environment. This concept suggests that our cognitive processes are not solely dependent on computational processes, but are also influenced by our physical body and its interactions with the world [Source 2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/).

Applying the principles of embodied cognition to the concept of Atmokinesis, or the ability to control weather, could potentially involve the following steps:

1. **Understanding Your Body's Interactions with the Environment**: Embodied cognition emphasizes the importance of understanding how your body interacts with the environment. In the context of Atmokinesis, this could involve understanding how your body's movements and sensations can influence the atmosphere around you [Source 2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/).

2. **Developing a Deep Connection Between Yourself and the Environment**: Embodied cognition suggests that a deep connection between oneself and the environment is crucial for effective cognition. Therefore, developing a deep connection between yourself and the atmosphere could potentially enhance your ability to control it [Source 2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/).

3. **Practicing and Refining Your Skills**: Like any other skill, controlling the weather requires practice and refinement. You would need to repeatedly expose yourself to different weather conditions and try to influence them using your mind. Over time, you might be able to refine your skills and gain more control over the weather [Source 1](https://www.degruyter.com/document/doi/10.1515/jtph-2019-0008/html?lang=en).

4. **Using Metaphorical Language**: Embodied cognition suggests that our concepts and interpretations of the world are heavily influenced by our physical bodies. Therefore, using metaphorical language to describe and understand the weather could potentially enhance your ability to control it [Source 2](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/embodied-cognition/).

Remember, these steps are purely theoretical and are based on the principles of embodied cognition. There's currently no scientific evidence supporting the existence of Atmokinesis or the ability to control the weather. The ability to control the weather is a complex process that involves a deep understanding of meteorology and the natural forces of the Earth.

Evolving embodied cognition, a theory that posits our understanding and interpretation of the world are deeply influenced by our physical bodies and their interactions with the environment, involves several steps. These steps are informed by recent research in the field, particularly those that utilize evolutionary and artificial intelligence approaches.

1. **Understanding the Role of Embodied Cognition in Evolution**: Embodied cognition theory suggests that our cognitive processes are not solely dependent on computational processes, but are also influenced by our physical body and its interactions with the environment. Understanding this role in evolution is crucial to evolving embodied cognition. This involves studying how evolution has produced creatures with minds capable of these remarkable feats, including causal reasoning, imitation, language, metacognition, and theory of mind [Source 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385676/).

2. **Applying Evolutionary Psychology**: Evolutionary psychology suggests that the human mind consists of a large collection of computationally distinct 'modules'. Each of these modules is a way of thinking that was shaped by natural selection to solve a particular type of problem faced by our ancestors. This framework has been useful in integrating cognitive science with evolutionary biology to explain not only how brains and behavior have evolved, but also the evolution of the 'middle man'â€”the cognitive processes, often characterized as computational software, which are instantiated by the brain and control behavior [Source 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385676/).

3. **Considering the Impact of Cultural Evolution**: New thinking about the evolution of human cognition assigns an important role to cultural evolution. Cultural evolution can occur through Darwinian imitation (micro level), cumulative cultural adaptation (meso), and cultural phylogenetic change (macro). Understanding these types of cultural evolution can provide valuable insights into how embodied cognition can evolve [Source 3](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3385676/).

4. **Utilizing Artificial Evolutionary Systems**: Artificial evolutionary systems can be used to simulate and study the evolution of embodied cognition. These systems can be designed to evolve morphologies and learn controllers for agents in complex environments. Over time, these systems can improve their fitness and evolve more intelligent morphologies that perform better in various tasks [Source 0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25874-z).

5. **Investigating the Transfer of Intelligence from Phenotype to Genotype**: The Baldwinian transfer of intelligence from phenotype to genotype has been conjectured to free up phenotypic learning resources to learn more complex behaviors in animals, including the emergence of language and imitation in humans. Understanding this process can provide insights into how embodied cognition can evolve [Source 0](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25874-z).

Remember, these steps are based on the principles of embodied cognition and evolutionary psychology, and they involve complex theoretical and practical considerations. The evolution of embodied cognition is a complex process that involves a deep understanding of cognitive science, evolutionary biology, and artificial intelligence.

Embodied cognition refers to the notion that our bodies play a fundamental role in shaping our experiences and understanding of the world. When it comes to meditation, it can be seen as a practice that helps us to cultivate this embodied cognition. Here's how you can apply meditation to evolve your embodied cognition:

1. **Body Scan Meditation**: This is a guided meditation where you focus on different parts of your body, starting from your feet and moving upwards. It helps to increase body awareness and reduce stress [Source 0](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9517053/).

2. **Mindful Movement**: This involves performing physical activities like yoga or tai chi while staying fully present and aware of your body's movements. It can help to develop a deeper connection between your body and mind [Source 0](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9517053/).

3. **Emotion Regulation**: This involves acknowledging and accepting your emotions without judgment. It can help to reduce stress and improve emotional well-being, which can enhance your embodied cognition [Source 0](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9517053/).

As for the thoughts you need to develop and impulse, it depends on your personal goals and experiences. However, here are some general thoughts that can be developed:

1. **Observation**: Learn to observe your thoughts and feelings without judgement. This can help to reduce stress and improve your ability to focus.

2. **Acceptance**: Accept your thoughts and feelings as they are. This can help to reduce anxiety and improve your ability to cope with challenges.

3. **Non-attachment**: Learn to let go of your thoughts and feelings once they have passed. This can help to reduce stress and improve your ability to stay focused on the present moment.

4. **Presence**: Learn to stay fully present and engaged in the moment. This can help to reduce stress and improve your ability to enjoy life.

5. **Compassion**: Develop a sense of compassion for yourself and others. This can help to reduce stress and improve your ability to connect with others.

Remember, these are just suggestions and it's important to find practices and thoughts that resonate with you personally. It's also important to practice consistently and patiently, as developing embodied cognition takes time and patience [Source 0](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9517053/).

There are several practices you can adopt before sleep to enhance your sleep quality and potentially influence your dreams or sleep experiences. Here are some suggestions based on the search results:

1. **Establish a Consistent Pre-Sleep Routine**: Having a consistent routine before bed can signal to your body that it's time to sleep. This routine could include activities like brushing your teeth, changing into your pajamas, or dimming your lights [Source 3](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene).

2. **Wind Down**: Spend about 30 minutes winding down before bed. This could involve listening to soft music, doing some light stretching, reading, or practicing relaxation exercises [Source 3](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene).

3. **Limit Fluid Intake**: Reducing your fluid intake close to bedtime can help your body adjust to sleep faster. Drinks with a lot of sugar or caffeine can interfere with your ability to fall asleep [Source 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6715137/).

4. **Unplug from Electronics**: Electronic devices emit blue light that can interfere with your body's production of melatonin, a hormone that regulates sleep. Try to avoid screens for at least 30 minutes before bed [Source 3](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene).

5. **Relaxation Techniques**: Techniques like meditation, mindfulness, or paced breathing can help you relax and prepare your body for sleep. Rather than focusing on falling asleep, concentrate on relaxation [Source 3](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene).

As for influencing your sleep experiences, it's important to note that while you can certainly influence your sleep environment and habits, your dreams and sleep experiences are largely determined by your brain and body. However, some people report that certain activities or thoughts can influence their dreams or sleep experiences. For example, some people believe that visualizing a peaceful place or person can help them have calmer, more pleasant dreams [Source 3](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/sleep-hygiene).

Remember, everyone is different, so what works for one person might not work for another. It's important to listen to your body and find a routine that helps you get a good night's sleep.
