# Unlocking Full potential of Brain    

- Theories:
  - Awakening:
   
Liberating 100% of your brain's potential using awakening involves understanding and leveraging various aspects of your brain's functioning. Here are some steps you can take:
    
1. **Understand Brain Waves**: Alpha waves (8-12Hz) are known for promoting feelings of calmness and relaxation, making it easier to absorb information and reduce stress levels. Engaging with activities that promote alpha waves, such as reading, meditating, or moving your body, can help you absorb new information and ideas [Source 1](https://central.gymshark.com/article/rise-and-shine-how-to-tap-into-your-brain-waves-for-an-effective-morning).
    
2. **Create a Powerful Morning Routine**: Start your day positively with activities that bring you joy and meaning. Limiting time spent on your phone and incorporating visualization or meditation into your routine can help you tap into your brain's optimal frequency for creating what you want in life [Source 1](https://central.gymshark.com/article/rise-and-shine-how-to-tap-into-your-brain-waves-for-an-effective-morning).
   
3. **Engage Your Thoughts**: Belief can alter the structure of the brain to increase human potential. Your thoughts actually have the power to awaken parts of the brain that previously lay dormant [Source 2](http://www.awakeningthebrain.com/About-Awakening-The-Brain.html).
    
4. **Practice Positive Thinking**: Cultivate a positive outlook to maintain general mental health. Utilize positive thinking strategies to overcome challenges and achieve your goals. Creating a "mental to-do" list or setting challenging but achievable goals can help [Source 4](https://cubo.to/blog/how-to-unlock-your-brain-s-full-potential/).
    
5. **Meditate**: Meditation has been clinically proven to improve focus and attention span while decreasing stress levels. Regular meditation can help unlock your brain's full potential [Source 4](https://cubo.to/blog/how-to-unlock-your-brain-s-full-potential/).
   
6. **Set Goals**: Setting goals can help you achieve anything you set your mind to. Being specific and clear in what you intend to accomplish can be key [Source 4](https://cubo.to/blog/how-to-unlock-your-brain-s-full-potential/).
    
7. **Visualize**: Visualization is a powerful tool that can help you unlock your brain's full potential. By envisioning yourself accomplishing your objectives, you increase your chances of actually succeeding [Source 4](https://cubo.to/blog/how-to-unlock-your-brain-s-full-potential/).
    
8. **Manage Stress**: Excessive stress can harm our emotional and physical health. Concentrating on your objectives rather than the barriers that hinder you can help manage stress [Source 4](https://cubo.to/blog/how-to-unlock-your-brain-s-full-potential/).
   
9. **Get Enough Sleep**: Your brain's capacity to perform at its optimum can suffer from not getting enough sleep. The National Sleep Foundation recommends 7 hours of sleep every night for adults. Insufficient sleep can alter how your brain works [Source 4](https://cubo.to/blog/how-to-unlock-your-brain-s-full-potential/).
     
By implementing these steps, you can effectively awaken your brain and unlock its full potential.
    
Unlocking the brain part responsible for physics control and levitation of objects seems to be a concept that blurs the lines between reality and fiction, particularly given the current understanding of neuroscience and physics. However, I can provide some insights based on the search results and the principles of physics and neuroscience.
     
1. **Telekinesis**: This is the hypothetical ability to influence a physical system without physical interaction. The term comes from the Greek words "tele," meaning "far off," and "kinesis," meaning "movement." The idea of telekinesis has been a staple of science fiction, but there's no reliable scientific evidence supporting its existence [Source 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telekinesis).
     
2. **Neuroscience and Physics**: The brain doesn't have a specific part that controls physics or allows for telekinetic abilities. Our understanding of the brain suggests that it uses physical forces such as electrical signals to communicate between different parts of the brain and to send instructions to the rest of the body. Any movement of a spoon with the mind would involve the manipulation of those atoms through the four forces of nature: the strong nuclear force, the weak nuclear force, electromagnetism, and gravitation [Source 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telekinesis).
     
3. **Game Mechanics**: In video games like "Control", there are mechanisms that simulate the ability to control objects or levitate. These mechanisms are created by game developers using programming languages like C++ or Unity, and they don't reflect actual physics or neuroscience. For instance, in "Control", you can unlock the ability to levitate by defeating Salvador and returning to the Astral Plane [Source 2](https://www.eurogamer.net/control-walkthrough-guide-tips-6043?page=13).
     
4. **Real-World Applications**: While there isn't any scientific basis for controlling physics or levitating objects with the mind, there are certain phenomena that might resemble these concepts. For example, some people claim to be able to levitate objects using their minds, but these claims are often debunked by scientists. In some cases, the objects may be moved due to electrostatic charges or magnetic fields, rather than through telekinesis [Source 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telekinesis).
     
In conclusion, while it's fascinating to imagine a brain part responsible for physics control and levitation of objects, currently, there's no scientific evidence supporting such a concept. The brain's capabilities are grounded in the laws of physics, and the idea of telekinesis remains largely in the realm of fiction.     

The human brain is composed of various regions, each with unique responsibilities. However, if we consider the concept of unlocking a "telekinesis" power, we need to understand that there's currently no scientific evidence supporting such a claim. That said, there are certain areas of the brain that are responsible for controlling voluntary movements, which might be relevant in this context.

1. **Motor Cortex**: Located in the frontal lobe, the motor cortex is responsible for planning and executing voluntary movements. It contains areas dedicated to the control of different parts of the body, such as the fingers, face, and tongue [Source 3](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/a/overview-of-neuron-structure-and-function).

2. **Basal Ganglia**: This is a group of subcortical nuclei involved in a variety of functions including voluntary motor control, procedural learning, habit formation, and the regulation of eye movements. It plays a significant role in the initiation of voluntary motor activity [Source 3](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/a/overview-of-neuron-structure-and-function).

To "unlock" these areas, or increase their activity, you might consider engaging in activities that stimulate these areas. This could include physical exercises that challenge your motor skills, or cognitive exercises that stimulate your brain. However, it's important to remember that these activities won't grant you telekinesis or any similar supernatural abilities.

Moreover, researchers have used techniques like trans-cranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to temporarily induce specific states or behaviors in normally functioning brains. This method involves applying a small electric current to the scalp, which can stimulate or suppress activity in specific brain regions. While this technique has been used to study and treat conditions like depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder, it's not clear whether it could be used to "unlock" the brain's supposed telekinesis power [Source 3](https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/human-biology/neuron-nervous-system/a/overview-of-neuron-structure-and-function).
