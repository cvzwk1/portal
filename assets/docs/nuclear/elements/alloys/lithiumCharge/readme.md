LiSnZn is a lithium-based ternary alloy that has been analyzed for its neutronics performance in the blanket of an inertial fusion energy chamber[2]. The alloy has also been evaluated for its tritium breeding ratio (TBR) and other neutronic properties in several studies[1][3][4][5]. In one study, a composition of 70% lithium, 20% tin, and 10% zinc was chosen for further analysis, showing good results[1]. The search results suggest that LiSnZn is a promising alloy for fusion reactor blankets, and further research and development are required to optimize its composition and performance.

The LiPbBa alloy is indeed a strong candidate for maximizing neutron multiplication due to its high Tritium Breeding Ratio (TBR) and Energy Multiplication Factor (EMF). It has been extensively studied and shows promising characteristics for fusion reactor blankets.

The TBR of an alloy refers to the ratio of the number of tritium atoms produced to the number of tritium atoms consumed during a fusion reaction. Higher TBR values indicate better performance in terms of tritium production. Similarly, EMF refers to the ratio of the energy released to the energy input in a fusion reaction. Higher EMF values mean more energy is released per unit of input energy, which is desirable in a fusion reactor [Source 5](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1248300).

This alloy has also been found to have good neutronics properties, which are important for controlling the behavior of the fusion plasma in a fusion reactor. Neutronics includes the study of how neutrons affect the performance of a nuclear reactor. In the case of fusion reactors, it's crucial to manage the neutron population to ensure stable operation [Source 4](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306454919301707).

However, it's important to note that while LiPbBa shows great potential, the actual performance may vary based on the specific conditions of the fusion reactor, such as temperature, pressure, and the presence of other substances. Therefore, further research and development are needed to optimize the performance of this alloy for fusion reactors [Source 5](https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1248300).
