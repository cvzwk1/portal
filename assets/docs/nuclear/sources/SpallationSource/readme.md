A spallation neutron source is a powerful tool in scientific research, particularly in fields like materials science, chemistry, physics, and engineering. It produces neutrons by bombarding a heavy atom (like gold, tungsten, or tantalum) with high-energy protons. Here is a basic recipe for setting up a spallation neutron source:

1. **Select a Target Material:** Choose a heavy, stable atom like gold, tungsten, or tantalum. These materials are used because they can absorb a high amount of energy and release it in the form of neutrons when struck by a high-energy proton [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation_Neutron_Source).

2. **Create a Proton Beam:** Use a linear particle accelerator, or linac, to generate a beam of protons. The protons are accelerated to an energy of about one GeV, which is roughly 90% the speed of light [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation_Neutron_Source).

3. **Strip Off Electrons:** Pass the protons through a foil that strips off each proton's electrons, converting it to a bare proton [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation_Neutron_Source).

4. **Accumulate Protons:** Direct the protons into a ring-shaped structure called a proton accumulator ring. Here, the protons spin around at very high speeds and accumulate in "bunches". Each bunch of protons is released from the ring as a pulse, at a rate of 60 times per second [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation_Neutron_Source).

5. **Target Striking:** The high-energy proton pulses strike the target material, causing spallation. This is when the heavy atom absorbs the energy from the protons and breaks apart into smaller fragments, releasing neutrons [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation_Neutron_Source).

6. **Moderate and Guide Neutrons:** The spalled neutrons are then slowed in a moderator and guided through beam lines to areas containing special instruments where they can be used in a wide variety of experiments [Source 0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spallation_Neutron_Source).

Please note that this is a simplified explanation. Setting up a spallation neutron source requires a detailed understanding of nuclear physics and particle accelerators, as well as access to specialized equipment and facilities.
